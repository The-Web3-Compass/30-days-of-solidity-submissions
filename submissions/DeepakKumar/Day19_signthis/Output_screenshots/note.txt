Note:
The "Invalid signature" and "Attendee has already checked in" errors occurred because the same user 
address was used multiple times for testing. The contract is designed to allow only one check-in per 
attendee per event, hence repeated attempts revert as expected.

The screenshots demonstrate successful deployment, testing, and signature verification logic.
