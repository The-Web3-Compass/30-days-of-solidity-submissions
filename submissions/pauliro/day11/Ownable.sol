   Build a secure Vault contract that only the owner (master key holder) can control. 
   You'll split your logic into two parts: a reusable 'Ownable' base contract and a 'VaultMaster' 
   contract that inherits from it. 
   Only the owner can withdraw funds or transfer ownership. 
   This shows how to use Solidity's inheritance model to write clean, reusable access control patterns â€” 
   just like in real-world production contracts. 
   It's like building a secure digital safe where only the master key holder can access or delegate control.
