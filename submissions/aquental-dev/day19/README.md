Concepts

- ecrecover
- verifying signatures
- basic authentication

Progression

- Introduces cryptographic authentication.

Example Application

Build a secure signature-based entry system for a private Web3 event, like a conference, workshop, or token-gated meetup. Instead of storing an on-chain whitelist of attendees, your backend or event organizer signs a message for each approved guest. When attendees arrive, they submit their signed message to the smart contract to prove they were invited. The contract uses `ecrecover` to verify the signature on-chain, confirming their identity without needing any prior on-chain registration. This pattern drastically reduces gas costs, keeps the contract lightweight, and mirrors how many real-world events handle off-chain approvals with on-chain validation â€” a practical Web3 authentication flow.

## testing

- deploy with address `0xc2572E65d61aFa5DD6BcFAC57305Bb59EBD9A54E`
- on the script tab, run `scripts/SignThisScript.ts`

```json
Message Hash:
