Concepts

- msg.sender
- address
- Ether balance

Progression

- Applies address type, msg.sender, and Ether handling.

Example Application

Let's make a digital piggy bank! Users can deposit and withdraw Ether (the cryptocurrency). You'll learn how to manage balances (using `address` to identify users) and track who sent Ether (using `msg.sender`). It's like a simple bank account on the blockchain, demonstrating how to handle Ether and user addresses.
