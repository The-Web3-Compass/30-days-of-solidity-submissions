# Day 4 of 30

Concepts

- if/else statements
- Time (block.timestamp)
- Basic bidding

Progression

- Adds control flow and time management.

Example Application

Create a basic auction! Users can bid on an item, and the highest bidder wins when time runs out. You'll use 'if/else' to decide who wins based on the highest bid and track time using the blockchain's clock (`block.timestamp`). This is like a simple version of eBay on the blockchain, showing how to control logic based on conditions and time.
