Concepts

- Interacting with oracles
- fetching off-chain data

Progression

- Introduces external data integration.

Example Application

Build a smart contract that retrieves live weather data using an oracle like Chainlink. You'll create a decentralized crop insurance contract where farmers can claim insurance if rainfall drops below a certain threshold during the growing season. Since the Ethereum blockchain can't access real-world data on its own, you'll use an oracle to fetch off-chain weather information and trigger payouts automatically. This project demonstrates how to securely integrate external data into your contract logic and highlights the power of real-world connectivity in smart contracts.
