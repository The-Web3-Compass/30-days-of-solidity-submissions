# Day 8 of 30

Concepts

- conversion
- denominations
- payable

Progression

- Expands on basic Ether transfers by introducing access control, tracking contributions, and simulating real-world currency handling — preparing you for more complex contract logic.

Example Application

Build a multi-currency digital tip jar! Users can send Ether directly or simulate tips in foreign currencies like USD or EUR. You'll learn how to manage currency conversion, handle Ether payments using `payable` and `msg.value`, and keep track of individual contributions. Think of it like an advanced version of a 'Buy Me a Coffee' button — but smarter, more global, and Solidity-powered.
