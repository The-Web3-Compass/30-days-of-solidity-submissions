# Day 15 of 30

Concepts

- Gas optimization
- Efficient data locations
- Calldata vs memory
- Minimizing storage writes

Progression

- Applies earlier knowledge of storage by challenging learners to minimize gas costs in a real-world contract scenario.

Example Application

Build a simple voting system where users can vote on proposals. Your challenge is to make it as gas-efficient as possible. Optimize how you store voter data, handle input parameters, and design functions. You'll learn how `calldata`, `memory`, and `storage` affect gas usage and discover small changes that lead to big savings. It's like designing a voting machine that runs faster and cheaper without losing accuracy.
