# Day 14 of 30

Concepts

- Interfaces
- Abstraction
- Ownership Transfer
- Contract-to-contract interaction

Progression

- Extends ownership and access control by introducing standardized interaction between modular contracts and enabling transferable access through interfaces.
- Example Application

Build a smart bank that offers different types of deposit boxes â€” basic, premium, time-locked, etc. Each box follows a common interface and supports ownership transfer. A central VaultManager contract interacts with all deposit boxes in a unified way, letting users store secrets and transfer ownership like handing over the key to a digital locker. This teaches interface design, modularity, and how contracts communicate with each other safely.
