# Day 2 of 30

Concepts

- State variables (string, bool)
- Storage and retrieval

Progression

- Introduces data types and state management.

Example Application

Imagine creating a basic profile. You'll make a contract where users can save their name (like 'Alice') and a short bio (like 'I build dApps'). You'll learn how to store text (using `string`) on the blockchain. Then, you'll create functions to let users save and retrieve this information. This demonstrates how to store and retrieve data on the blockchain, essential for building profiles or user data storage.
