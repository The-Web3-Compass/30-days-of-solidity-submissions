# Day 3 of 30

Concepts

- Arrays (uint[])
- Mappings (mapping(address => uint))
- Simple voting logic

Progression

- Introduces complex data structures (arrays, mappings) and logic.

Example Application

Let's build a simple polling station! Users will be able to vote for their favorite candidates. You'll use lists (arrays, `uint[]`) to store candidate details. You'll also create a system (mappings, `mapping(address => uint)`) to remember who (their `address`) voted for which candidate. Think of it as a digital voting booth. This teaches you how to manage data in a structured way.
