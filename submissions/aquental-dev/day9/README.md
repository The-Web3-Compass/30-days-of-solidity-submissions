# Day 9 of 30

Concepts

- calling functions of another contract
- address casting
- imports

Progression

- Introduces inter-contract communication.

Example Application

Build a contract that uses another contract to do calculations. You'll learn how contracts can talk to each other by calling functions of other contracts (using `address casting`). It's like having one app ask another app to do some math, showing how to interact with other contracts.
