# 🏋️ Day 10 — FitTrack: Decentralized Fitness Tracker

## 📖 Overview

**FitTrack** is a blockchain-based fitness tracker that allows users to log their workouts and automatically unlock on-chain achievements. It demonstrates how decentralized apps can be used for lifestyle tracking, reward systems, and event-driven updates.

Users can record workout details such as the type, duration, and calories burned. The smart contract tracks total progress, monitors weekly goals, and emits blockchain events when milestones are achieved — serving as the backend for a decentralized fitness ecosystem.
