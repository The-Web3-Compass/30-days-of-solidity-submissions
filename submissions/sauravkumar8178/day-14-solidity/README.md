# üè¶ Day 14 of #30DaysOfSolidity ‚Äî Smart Bank with Modular Deposit Boxes

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this challenge, we build a **Smart Bank** that provides users with different kinds of digital deposit boxes ‚Äî **Basic**, **Premium**, and **Time-Locked**. Each box allows users to securely store their data (or encrypted secrets), transfer ownership, and interact seamlessly through a unified **VaultManager** contract.

The goal of this project is to understand **interface design**, **contract modularity**, and **secure inter-contract communication** in Solidity ‚Äî key concepts for scalable decentralized applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you‚Äôll learn how to:

* Design and implement a **common interface** for multiple contracts.
* Build **modular smart contracts** that follow the same interaction patterns.
* Use **ownership transfer** mechanisms for asset or access handover.
* Understand how **a manager contract interacts** with sub-contracts safely.
* Apply **best security practices** (access control, time locks, and value transfers).

## üß© System Architecture

### üîê 1. Deposit Box Interface (`IDepositBox`)

A universal contract interface defining the required functions:

* `storeSecret(bytes secret)` ‚Äî Stores encrypted or hashed data.
* `retrieveSecret()` ‚Äî Allows the owner to access stored data.
* `transferBoxOwnership(address newOwner)` ‚Äî Transfers ownership securely.
* `owner()` ‚Äî Returns the current box owner.

All deposit box types must implement this interface to ensure compatibility with the **VaultManager**.

### üì¶ 2. Deposit Box Types

#### üß± BasicBox

A simple box that allows users to store and retrieve secrets freely.
Only the **owner** can retrieve the stored data.

#### üíé PremiumBox

An upgraded version that requires a **fee** to store secrets.
The collected fees can later be withdrawn by the box owner ‚Äî simulating a **paid storage plan**.

#### ‚è≥ TimeLockedBox

A time-restricted box where the stored secret can only be accessed **after a specified unlock time**.
Ideal for use cases like **escrow, delayed release, or savings vaults**.

---

### üóÉÔ∏è 3. VaultManager

A centralized management contract that:

* Creates and registers all deposit boxes.
* Interacts with any box through the common interface.
* Lets users:

  * Create new boxes (`createBasicBox`, `createPremiumBox`, `createTimeLockedBox`)
  * Store secrets on any box (`storeOnBox`)
  * Retrieve stored data (`retrieveFromBox`)
  * Transfer ownership (`transferBoxOwnership`)

The manager acts like the **bank operator**, handling multiple lockers (boxes) in a unified, secure way.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **VaultManager** deploys and tracks all deposit boxes.
2. Users can create a new box of any type through the manager.
3. Each box stores encrypted or hashed secrets (for real-world privacy).
4. Owners can retrieve or transfer their boxes to other users.
5. The manager can call box functions without needing to know their internal logic ‚Äî thanks to the shared interface.

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced

* Solidity **interfaces and inheritance**
* **Contract composition** & modular architecture
* **Secure access control** (ownership, permissions)
* **ETH value transfers** & payable functions
* **Time-based restrictions** using `block.timestamp`
* **Designing scalable dApp ecosystems**

---

## üîí Security Considerations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** On-chain data is public. Never store real secrets in plaintext.

* Use **encryption** or **hashing** before storing any sensitive data.
* Apply **Reentrancy Guards** if contracts handle user funds.
* Always **validate ownership** before transferring boxes.
* Use **events** for tracking all state changes (already implemented).

---

## üí° Example Use Cases

* Digital locker system for confidential documents
* Multi-tier storage service (free, premium, delayed)
* Escrow and inheritance smart contracts
* NFT metadata or encrypted data vaults

---

## üßæ Suggested Improvements

* Integrate **off-chain encryption** and IPFS storage.
* Add **multi-sig control** for joint ownership.
* Implement **upgradeable contract pattern** (UUPS / Proxy).
* Include **gas optimization** and **role-based access** for enterprise use.
