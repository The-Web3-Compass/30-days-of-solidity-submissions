# 🛡️ Day 19 of #30DaysOfSolidity — Signature-Based Entry System for Private Web3 Events

### 🔗 Project: Secure Signature-Based Entry Verification (Gas-Efficient Whitelisting)

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a **gas-efficient and secure signature-based entry system** for private Web3 events such as conferences, workshops, or token-gated meetups.

Instead of maintaining an on-chain whitelist of attendees, event organizers **sign off-chain invitations** for approved guests. Guests then present this **signed proof** on-chain to claim access. The smart contract verifies authenticity using `ecrecover`, ensuring the signer (organizer) approved the attendee without requiring any pre-registration or whitelist storage.

This approach mirrors real-world event access control—off-chain approvals with on-chain verification—reducing gas costs and simplifying the invite management process.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* ✅ **Off-chain authorization** — organizer signs invites using their private key
* 🔐 **On-chain signature verification** — attendees prove authenticity using `ecrecover`
* 🧾 **No on-chain whitelist needed** — reduces gas and storage costs
* ⏰ **Expiration & replay protection** — expiry timestamps and nonces prevent misuse
* 🔁 **Organizer rotation support** — secure update mechanism for authorized signer
* 🧩 **Modular & upgradeable pattern** — ideal base for EIP-712 or MetaMask-verified flows

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Organizer signs an invite** off-chain containing:

   * Attendee address
   * Event ID
   * Expiry time
   * Nonce (unique ID to prevent replay)

2. **Attendee receives** the signed message (via email, QR code, or backend API).

3. **Attendee connects wallet** and calls `claim()` on the smart contract, submitting:

   * Event details (event ID, expiry, nonce)
   * The organizer’s signature

4. **Contract verifies** the signature on-chain:

   * Confirms the recovered signer matches the organizer address
   * Ensures the signature hasn’t expired or been reused

5. **Access granted!**
   The contract emits an `EntryGranted` event, confirming the user’s verified entry.

---

## 💻 Frontend Demo

A simple **React + Ethers.js** interface allows attendees to:

* Connect their wallet
* Paste their event details and signature
* Submit a transaction to claim access

Once verified, the contract emits an event confirming successful entry.

---

## 🧾 Off-chain Signing (Organizer)

A **Node.js script** helps the organizer generate valid signatures for attendees.
It ensures the off-chain message format matches the contract’s hashing logic.

The organizer can sign multiple invites using a single private key and distribute them to verified guests securely (email, API, or QR).

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* Each signature includes:

  * Attendee address (prevents reuse by others)
  * Expiry timestamp (prevents indefinite validity)
  * Nonce (prevents replay within timeframe)

* Organizer keys must remain **off-chain and private**.

* Consider implementing **EIP-712 typed data signing** for improved UX and wallet support.

* Rotate the organizer key securely using the contract’s update function when needed.

* Avoid embedding private keys in frontend code — always sign server-side.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* 🌐 Upgrade to **EIP-712 structured signatures** for MetaMask compatibility
* 📱 Generate **QR codes** for signed invitations
* 🔄 Add **multi-organizer support** or admin roles
* 🧾 Track attendance statistics on-chain
* 🧱 Integrate with event ticketing dApps or DAO membership systems

---

## 📚 Learning Takeaways

* Using `ecrecover` for on-chain signature verification
* Implementing secure, gas-efficient access control
* Bridging **off-chain authentication** with **on-chain validation**
* Building trustless invitation workflows without storing whitelists

---

## 🏁 Summary

This project is a practical implementation of **signature-based authentication** for decentralized events — blending off-chain flexibility with on-chain verification. It’s lightweight, secure, and ready to integrate into any **token-gated event, private sale, or VIP-access dApp**.
