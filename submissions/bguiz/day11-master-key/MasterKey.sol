 * @title MasterKey
 * @dev Build a secure Vault contract that only the owner (master key holder) can control.
 * You'll split your logic into two parts: a reusable 'Ownable' base contract and a 'VaultMaster' contract that inherits from it.
 * Only the owner can withdraw funds or transfer ownership. This shows how to use Solidity's inheritance model to write clean,
 * reusable access control patterns â€” just like in real-world production contracts.
 * It's like building a secure digital safe where only the master key holder can access or delegate control.
