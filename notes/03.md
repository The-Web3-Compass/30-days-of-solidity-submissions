Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of **all important concepts and key definitions** from this lecture ‚Äî along with **clear explanations** of each term and idea:

---

## üß± 1. Smart Contract

**Definition:**
A program written in Solidity that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Meaning:**
It defines logic and data (like rules for voting and lists of candidates) that are stored permanently on the blockchain and can be executed automatically when certain conditions are met.
In this lecture, the **polling station** is the smart contract.

---

## üß∞ 2. Remix IDE

**Definition:**
An online development environment for writing, compiling, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts.

**Meaning:**
It allows developers to quickly prototype and interact with contracts directly in a web browser, without needing a local blockchain setup.

---

## üìú 3. SPDX License Identifier

**Definition:**
A line like `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` at the top of a Solidity file.

**Meaning:**
It specifies the license under which the code is released, ensuring compliance and transparency in open-source projects. Solidity requires this line for compilation.

---

## üì¶ 4. Arrays

**Definition:**
An ordered list (or sequence) of elements of the same data type.

**Meaning:**
Arrays in Solidity are used to store multiple items (like candidate names). They are indexed starting at 0, so you can access items by their position.

**Example from lecture:**

```solidity
string[] public candidateNames;
```

This creates a **dynamic array** of candidate names, which can grow as new candidates are added.

---

## üîÅ 5. Dynamic Array

**Definition:**
An array that can change its length ‚Äî items can be added (using `.push()`) or removed.

**Meaning:**
Dynamic arrays are ideal when you don‚Äôt know beforehand how many elements there will be (like a list of candidates that can grow).

**Example:**
`candidateNames.push("Alice");`

---

## üóùÔ∏è 6. Mappings

**Definition:**
A Solidity data structure that stores data in **key-value pairs**.

**Meaning:**
It works like a vending machine ‚Äî you insert a key, and it gives you the value.
Mappings are used for fast lookups, e.g., tracking votes per candidate.

**Example:**

```solidity
mapping(string => uint256) public votes;
```

Here, the candidate‚Äôs name (a `string`) is the key, and the number of votes (`uint256`) is the value.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Default Behavior of Mappings

**Definition:**
Mappings automatically return a default value (like `0`) for keys that haven‚Äôt been assigned yet.

**Meaning:**
If a candidate hasn‚Äôt received any votes, calling `votes["Alice"]` returns `0` by default.

---

## üß© 8. Functions

**Definition:**
Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

**Meaning:**
In Solidity, functions define the contract‚Äôs behavior ‚Äî like adding a candidate, voting, or getting results.

Key functions in this lecture:

* `addCandidates(string memory _name)`
* `vote(string memory _candidateName)`
* `getCandidateNames()`
* `getVote(string memory _candidateName)`

---

## üìç 9. Function Visibility: `public`, `view`, etc.

**Definition:**
Specifiers that define **who can access** the function and **whether it modifies** blockchain state.

**Meaning:**

* `public`: callable by anyone.
* `view`: read-only; doesn‚Äôt change the blockchain state.

Example:

```solidity
function getCandidateNames() public view returns (string[] memory)
```

This can be called freely and doesn‚Äôt cost gas because it only reads data.

---

## üíæ 10. Memory vs. Storage

**Definition:**

* **Storage:** Permanent data stored on the blockchain.
* **Memory:** Temporary data used only during function execution.

**Meaning:**
When a function handles strings or arrays temporarily, they are marked as `memory` (not stored permanently).

Example:

```solidity
function addCandidates(string memory _name) public
```

The string `_name` exists only during the function call.

---

## üó≥Ô∏è 11. Vote Function Logic

**Definition:**
The process of recording a vote by incrementing a candidate‚Äôs vote count in the mapping.

**Meaning:**
It uses the mapping to find the candidate‚Äôs vote count and increases it by one:

```solidity
votes[_candidateName]++;
```

---

## üîç 12. Getter Functions

**Definition:**
Functions used to retrieve data from the blockchain.

**Meaning:**
Since mappings and arrays can‚Äôt easily return all data at once, getter functions like `getCandidateNames()` and `getVote()` are written to make it easier for users and front-end apps to display results.

---

## üîê 13. Access Control (Suggested Improvement)

**Definition:**
Mechanisms that restrict who can call certain functions (like `onlyOwner` or admin-only permissions).

**Meaning:**
To prevent abuse ‚Äî for example, only the contract creator should be able to add candidates.

---

## üö´ 14. Voting Restrictions (Suggested Improvement)

**Definition:**
Rules to ensure fairness, like ‚Äúone vote per person.‚Äù

**Meaning:**
Typically implemented by tracking which addresses have already voted, using another mapping like:

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
```

---

## üß† 15. Best Practices

**Definition:**
General guidelines to write efficient and secure smart contracts.

**Meaning:**
Includes:

* Keeping code modular (clear functions)
* Using proper data types (`mapping` and `array`)
* Implementing access control
* Writing clear comments and license info
