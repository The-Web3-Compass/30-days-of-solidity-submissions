| Contract       | Like a class that lives forever on-chain    | Groups variables + functions                |
| Function       | Action or logic within a contract           | Executes when users call it                 |
| State Variable | Stored in blockchain `storage`              | Permanent, costs gas to update              |
| Memory         | Temporary storage in function execution     | Cheaper, erased after use                   |
| Gas            | Fee for computation and storage on Ethereum | Equivalent to paying for cloud compute time |
